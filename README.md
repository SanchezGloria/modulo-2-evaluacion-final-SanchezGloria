This project 👩🏾‍💻 is intended to build a website where users can browse amongst different series 📽 and mark their preferences as favourites ❤️

First step: Bring information from API with the data input in the search field ✔️

On clicking on the button "Search" the application connects to the API TV Maze in search of series. For each show contained in the result of the search, a card appears showing an image of the series and its title. 

Second step: Add series to favourites ✔️

Once the results of the search appear, we can indicate which are our favourite series. To do that, once you click on a series, the background colour changes indicating that this is a favourite series. Moreover, it appears in a list on the left of the screen as well, under the search field, along with the favourite series. 

Third step: Delete series from favourites ✔️

On clicking on the selected serie, we can delete our favourite serie. At the same time, it will become unmarked in the list of search results too.
